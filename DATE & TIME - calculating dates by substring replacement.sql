/*

!!DATE & TIME - CALCULATING DATES BY SUBSTRING REPLACEMENT!!

> Given a date, you want to produce another date from it when you know that the two
dates share some components in common

> Treat a date or time value as a string, and perform direct replacement on parts of the
string

*/

/*
> In some cases, you can use substring replacement to calculate dates without performing
any date arithmetic

EXAMPLE:
1) string operation produces the first-of-month value for a given date by replacing the 
day component with 01. You can do this either with DATE_FORMAT() or with CONCAT()

> The string replacement technique can also produce dates with a specific position within
the calendar year
2) For New Yearâ€™s Day (January 1), replace the month and day with 01;
for Christmas, replace the month and day with 12 and 25

3) The following statement shows two ways to determine the date for Christmas two years hence
