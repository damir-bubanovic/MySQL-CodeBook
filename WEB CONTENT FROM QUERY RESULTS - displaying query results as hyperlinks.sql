/*
> Website URLs or email addresses stored in a table are easily converted to active links in 
web pages. 
	>> You need only properly encode the information and add the appropriate HTML tags
	
EXAMPLE:
1) Table named book_vendor contains bookseller and publisher names and websites

2) Hyperlinked text

3) Use foreach to generate list

/*
> Generating links using email addresses is another common web programming task

EXAMPLE:
1) Table named newsstaff lists the department, name, and (if known) email
address for the news anchors and reporters employed by a television station

2) Email formating

3) Use function
	> First, put the code to generate an email link into a helper function because 
	that operation is likely to be useful in multiple scripts
	> The function handles instances where the person has no email address by returning 
	just the name as static text. 
		>> To use the function, write a loop that pulls out names and addresses and 
		displays each email link preceded by the staff memberâ€™s department
