!!VALIDATING & REFORMATING DATA - BASIC!!

> Ff you donâ€™t know whether the values contained in a file are legal, preprocess it to check or
reformat them. 
> Numeric values may need verification as lying within a specific range, dates may need conversion 
to or from ISO format, and so forth

> The chapter deals with formatting and validation issues primarily within the context of
checking entire files, but many of the techniques discussed here can be applied in other
situations as well
