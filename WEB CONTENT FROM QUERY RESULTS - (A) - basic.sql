!!GENERATING WEB CONTENT FROM QUERY RESULTS - BASIC!!

> Query results can be displayed as unstructured paragraphs or as structured elements
such as lists or tables. 
> Query metadata can be useful when formatting query results, too, such as when generating 
an HTML table that displays a result set and uses its metadata to get the column headings 
for the table
