> This chapter discusses stored database objects, which come in several varieties

Stored functions and procedures
	> A stored function or procedure object encapsulates the code for performing an
	operation, enabling you to invoke the object easily by name rather than repeat all
	its code each time itâ€™s needed. 
	> A stored function performs a calculation and returns a value that can be used in 
	expressions just like a built-in function such as RAND(), NOW(), or LEFT(). 
	> A stored procedure performs operations for which no return value is needed. 
	> Procedures are invoked with the CALL statement, not used in expressions.
	> A procedure might update rows in a table or produce a result set that is
	sent to the client program.
	
Triggers
	> A trigger is an object that activates when a table is modified by an INSERT, UPDATE,
	or DELETE statement. 
		>> npr. you can check values before they are inserted into a table, or specify that 
		any row deleted from a table should be logged to another table that serves as a 
		journal of data changes. 
	> Triggers automate these actions so that you need not remember to do them yourself 
	each time you modify a table.
	
Scheduled events
	> An event is an object that executes SQL statements at a scheduled time or times.
	> Think of a scheduled event as something like a Unix cron job that runs within MySQL. 
		>> npr. events can help you perform administrative tasks such as deleting old 
		table rows periodically or creating nightly summaries.
