!!PROCESSING WEB INPUT WITH MySQL - PROCESSING FILE UPLOADS!!

/*
1) To create a form that enables files to be uploaded, the opening <form> tag should specify
the post method and must also include an enctype (encoding type) attribute with a
value of multipart/form-data

2) To include a file upload field in the form, use an <input> element of type file. For
example, this element presents a 60-character file field named upload_file

PHP
1) To write an upload form in PHP, include a file field. If you like, also include a hidden
field preceding the file field that has a name of MAX_FILE_SIZE and a value of the largest
file size youâ€™re willing to accept

2) Information about files are available in the following variables

3) To simplify access to file upload information, use a utility routine that does the work
