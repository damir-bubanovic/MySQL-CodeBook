!!STATISTICS - PER-GROUP DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS!!

> You want to produce descriptive statistics for each subgroup of a set of observations

> Use aggregate functions, but employ a GROUP BY clause to arrange observations into the
appropriate groups

*/

/*
> To be more specific, use GROUP BY to divide the observations into groups and calculate 
statistics for each of them.
	>> npr. the subjects in the test score table are listed by age and sex, so itâ€™s possible 
	to calculate similar statistics by age or sex (or both) by application of appropriate 
	GROUP BY clauses

EXAMPLE:
1) How to calculate by age

2) By sex

3) By age and sex
