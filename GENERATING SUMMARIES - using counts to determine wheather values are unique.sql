!!GENERATING SUMMARIES - USING COUNTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER VALUES ARE UNIQUE!!

> You want to know whether values in a table are unique

> Use HAVING in conjunction with COUNT()

*/

/*
> DISTINCT eliminates duplicates but doesnâ€™t show which values actually were duplicated
in the original data. 
> You can use HAVING to find unique values in situations to which DISTINCT does not apply

EXAMPLE:
1) Show the days on which only one driver was active, and the days on which more than 
one driver was active

> This technique works for combinations of values, too
2) Find message sender/recipient pairs between whom only one message was sent, look for 
combinations that occur only once in the mail table
