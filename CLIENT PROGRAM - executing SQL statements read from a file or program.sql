!!BASIC - CLIENT PROGRAM - EXECUTING SQL STATEMENTS READ FROM A FILE OR PROGRAM!!

> You want mysql to read statements stored in a file so that you need not enter 
them manually. Or you want mysql to read the output from another program

> To read a file, redirect mysqlâ€™s input, or use the source command. 
To read from a program, use a pipe

EXAMPLE:
> To create an SQL script for mysql to execute in batch mode, put your statements in a
text file. Then invoke mysql and redirect its input to read from that file
