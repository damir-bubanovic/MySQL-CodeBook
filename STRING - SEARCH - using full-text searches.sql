!!WORKING WITH STRINGS - USING FULL-TEXT SEARCHES!!

> You want to search a lot of text

> Use a FULLTEXT index

*/

/*
> Pattern matches enable you to look through any number of rows, but as the amount of
text goes up, the match operation can become quite slow. 
> Itâ€™s also a common task to search for the same text in several string columns, 
but with pattern matching, that results in unwieldy queries

> A useful alternative is full-text searching, which is designed for looking through large
amounts of text and can search multiple columns simultaneously. 
	>> To use this capability, add a FULLTEXT index to your table, and then use the MATCH 
	operator to look for strings in the indexed column or columns

/*
EXAMPLE:
> searching the Bible
	>> TAble (Bible)

1) How many times does the name Hadoram occur?

2) To find out what those verses are, select the columns you want to see

3) To make sure a search result is sorted the way you want, 
add an explicit ORDER BY clause

4) To narrow the search further, include additional criteria
	> The following queries perform progressively more specific searches to determine how 
	often the name Abraham occurs in the entire KJV, the New Testament, the Book of Hebrews, 
	and Chapter 11 of Hebrews
